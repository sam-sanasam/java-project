Condition1:

Write a method called **toMilesPerHour** that has **1 parameter** of type **double** with the name **kilometersPerHour**. This method needs to return the **rounded values** of the calculation of type **long**.

If the parameter **kilometersPerHour** is less than **0**, the method **toMilesPerHour** needs to **return -1** to indicate an invalid values.
Otherwise, if it is **positive**, calculate the **values of the miles per hour** , **round it and return it**. 

Condtion 2:

Write a method called printCOnversion with 1 parameter of type double with the name kilometerPerHour.
This method should not return anything and it needs to calculate milesPerHour from the kilometerPerHour parameter. 
It need to print a message in the format "XX km/h = YY mi/h"

XX represent the original value kilometerPerHour

YY represent the round milesPerHour from the kilometerPerhOur parameter.

If the kilometesPerHour is <0, then print the text "invalidValue"





**LOGIC**
Steps:
1. Create the first method, do the conversin calculation
2. Create the 2nd method as void class, print the retur of the calculation
3. Create another class called **main**, call both the class and validate it.

**NOTE**
1. Write a class to define the class
2. Write a main class to validate above class.
* this code will define the how to call a method to another class.
* to call a method from another class.
